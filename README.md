# Genetic-Algorithm-Project

Completed in Summer 2019.

This is a course project for ECE 470: Artificial Intelligence at the University of Victoria, with the focus of this project being on the
implementation of a genetic algorithm on the subject of feature selection for classification. With
the background research material and the dataset for credit card fraud having been employed for
developing the final codebase, a compilation of the research and present dataset has subsequently
been applied for evaluating the proposed algorithm. Evaluation takes place by comparing the
classifier results when using random features versus the implemented algorithmâ€™s selected
features. Subsequently, principal component analysis was then theoretically and analytically
compared to the performance of the various versions of the formulated genetic algorithm. This
report outlines the related work, problem formulation, methodology, final results, and
conclusions obtained, which will be further verified in future research, development, and testing.
